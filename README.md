# RomCom  


### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

A romance novel cover generator generates unique, dynamic covers with user-chosen images, titles, and descriptiors. Users can save and delete covers, view them side-by-side, or delete them by double-clicking.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Click the *fork* button located in the upper right corner of your screen.
2. On your local machine, navigate to where you want to clone down the repo.
3. Clone your copy of the repository to your local machine using the command *git clone* [insert SSH code here]
4. Move into that new directory using *cd* *<directory name>* and open the project. 
5. View the project in the browser by entering *open index.html* in the terminal within your romcom directory.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
Only two weeks into our coding program with Turing, we worked as a team for around 20 hours in order to create code that makes this page functional. 
### Contributors:
[//]: <> Robert Phillips https://github.com/robert-phillips33 & Terra Manning https://github.com/TDManning

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
- Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
- Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
2. Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
3. Write code collaboratively
- Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
- Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
- Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins  
- Getting a good bit of experience coding javascript that actually creates a dynamic user experience by manipulating dom elements! It was definitely satisfying building our first web application.

- Working together as a team and collaborating to come up with solutions. 

#### Challenges 
- We started this project without all of the tools to complete it. Through a tremendous amount of perseverance we worked through it to completion.

- Throughout a lot of the project after the early iterations, we felt as though we knew what we wanted to do with the code to get the desired outcome, but not how to execute it. We definitely did learn a lot though, and will 100% be referencing our code from this project in order to help solve future problems. The biggest factor that enabled us to overcome this challenge was leaning into our cohort mates and asking tons of questions. While we did need a good bit of assistance to guide us in the right direction, I think we learned a lot and that is dope!!!
